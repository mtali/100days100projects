**Description:** This project creates a parallax effect using multiple background layers. The layers move at different
speeds to create a sense of depth.

* Canvas API

**How to Use:**

1. Clone the repository.
2. Open the `index.html` file in a web browser.

**Second Day of #100days100projects:**

Today is my second day of #100days100projects, and I am excited to share my parallax background effect project. I
learned a lot about the Canvas API and how to create animations using JavaScript. I am also pleased with the results of
the project, and I think it is a good example of what can be achieved with the Canvas API.

**Possible Improvements:**

* Add more background layers to create a more immersive effect.
* Add support for different screen sizes.
* Add a variety of different background images to choose from.
* Add the ability to control the speed of the layers.

**Contributions:**

I am open to contributions to this project. If you have any ideas for improvements or new features, please feel free to
create a pull request.
