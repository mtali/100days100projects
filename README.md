# #100Days100Projects

Hey there! ðŸ‘‹

This repository is home to my #100Days100Projects challenge. I'm building 100 projects in 100 days, and I'm sharing my
progress on social media using the #100Days100Projects hashtag.

I'm using a variety of programming languages and frameworks, so there should be something for everyone to enjoy. I'm
also trying to mix things up, so you'll see everything from simple apps and components to more complex websites and
games.

I'm doing this challenge to improve my coding skills, learn new things, and build a portfolio of my work. I'm also
hoping to inspire others to challenge themselves and learn new things.

If you're interested in following my progress, be sure to follow me on social media and use the #100Days100Projects
hashtag. You can also fork this repository and submit your own projects. I'd love to see what you come up with!

## Contribute to the challenge

There are a few ways to contribute to the challenge:

* Follow me on social media and share my progress using the #100Days100Projects hashtag.
* Fork this repository and submit your own projects.
* Give me feedback on my projects and help me improve.

## Tips for success

Here are a few tips for success:

* Start small. Don't try to build a complex project on day 1. Start with something simple and easy to complete.
* Set realistic goals. Don't try to build 10 projects in a week. Set a goal for yourself, such as building one project
  per day or one project per week.
* Don't be afraid to ask for help. If you get stuck on a project, don't be afraid to ask for help from a friend, mentor,
  or online community.
* Have fun! This is a challenge, but it's also an opportunity to learn and grow as a developer. So relax, have fun, and
  enjoy the process.

**I'm excited to see what we can accomplish together!**
